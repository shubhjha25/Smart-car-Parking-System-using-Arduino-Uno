# Smart-car-Parking-System-using-Arduino-Uno
Description :-
This project involves developing a Smart Car Parking System using an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The system is designed to automate parking space management by detecting and indicating the availability of parking spots. It aims to streamline the parking process, reduce congestion, and enhance the user experience.

Features :-
Parking Spot Detection: Utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of vehicles in parking spots.
Real-Time Status Display: Shows the availability of parking spaces using LEDs or an LCD display.
Automated Barriers: Controls entry and exit barriers based on parking space availability.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to easily understand parking availability.
Efficient Space Management: Optimizes the utilization of parking spaces and reduces congestion.

Components Used :-
Arduino Uno
Ultrasonic sensors
LEDs or LCD display
Servo motors for barriers
Breadboard and jumper wires
Power supply

Skills Demonstrated :-
Proficiency in Arduino programming
Integration of sensors and actuators
Real-time data processing and display
Hardware assembly and troubleshooting
Future Improvements
Implement a mobile app for remote monitoring of parking availability
Add payment processing for automated billing
Enhance security features with camera integration
